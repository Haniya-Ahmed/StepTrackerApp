This was created for CS1073 Introduction to Java class. 
This is command line app that allows  the user to enter the number of steps they take each day and will then generate a report for them. The app prompt the user to enter their “target number of steps”, this is their daily goal. The app then prompt the user to enter their daily number of steps for each day they were tracking them – the list must end with a negative number to indicate the end of the list. The report generated by the app includes the following information:
  • total number of days for the step tracker,
  • number of days they reached (met or exceeded) their target,
  • their highest number of steps, and
  • the average number of steps.
